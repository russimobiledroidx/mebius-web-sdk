# @mebius-io/web

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Align the gateway contract with mebius-stream-engine: pass the access token via the `?token=` query parameter (the form the engine enforces) and serve scale playback from `/live/{streamId}/index.m3u8`. Refresh package READMEs now that the packages are published to the npm registry (`npm i @mebius-io/*`); tarball is documented as the offline-only path.
